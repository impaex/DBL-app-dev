## How to use the app?

This will be a short explanation of how the app is used. This explanation will be updated with every major change to the app.

### Logging into the app with admin account
To get into the app easily, an admin account has been created. This is nothing more than a regular account to bypass the login screen.
Use these credentials to login:
- **Email:** `daniel.van.ziel7@gmail.com`
- **Password:** `123456789!`


## Get Started

### Importing project in Android Studio

To import the project into Android Studio, please follow the steps:

1. Open Android Studio, and `file > Close Project` if you have a project open.
2. In the window `Welcome to Android Studio`, click on `Get from VCS` in the top-right corner.
3. In the URL field, paste the following: `https://github.com/impaex/plantastic.git`, then click on `Clone`.
4. Android Studio will most likely ask whether to trust this gradle project. Press `Trust Project` to enable all functions.

### How to use Git(hub) in Android Studio?
Once you have imported the project into Android Studio, you will see these 3 buttons in the top-right of the program:

The left button allows you to pull the latest changes from the repository. This should always be done before you make any changes to the code. Always choose the merge option, not the rebase option.
The middle button allows you to commit your changes. For each commit, please shortly describe what changes you made, as this will help with keeping up with tasks and debugging.
The right button allows you to push your changes.

When we decide to work in multiple branches, you will find a button in the bottom-right of the screen, which tells you which branch you're in now (branch called `main` in the example), and by clicking on it, you can move to different branches:

Once you clicked on a branch, click `checkout` to go into the branch.

Before you switch branches, make sure you committed your changes!
