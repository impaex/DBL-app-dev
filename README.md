Our little android smart planner.



### Importing project in Android Studio

To import the project into Android Studio, please follow the steps:

1. Open Android Studio, and `file > Close Project` if you have a project open.
2. In the window `Welcome to Android Studio`, click on `Get from VCS` in the top-right corner.
3. In the URL field, paste the following: `https://github.com/impaex/plantastic.git`, then click on `Clone`.
4. Android Studio will most likely ask whether to trust this gradle project. Press `Trust Project` to enable all functions.

### How to use Git(hub) in Android Studio?
Once you have imported the project into Android Studio, you will see these 3 buttons in the top-right of the program:

The left button allows you to pull the latest changes from the repository. This should always be done before you make any changes to the code.
The middle button allows you to commit your changes.
The right button allows you to push your changes.

When we decide to work in multiple branches, you will find a button in the bottom-right of the screen, which tells you which branch you're in now (branch called `main` in the example), and by clicking on it, you can move to different branches:

Before you switch branches, make sure you committed your changes!
